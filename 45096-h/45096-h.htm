<h3>WILLIAM THE GALLANT.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The Kaiser, by gifts of roses, has been trying
to ingratiate himself with the Grand Duchess of Luxembourg, whose
country he has invaded in defiance of treaty obligations.</span></p>

<h2 class="sans">CHARIVARIA.</h2>

<p>"At every point," we read, "the Allies have made sensible
progress." So different from the stupid progress made very
occasionally by the enemy!</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>We have been asked to recommend suitable Fiction for reading during
the War. We have no hesitation in calling attention to the claims of
the war news from Amsterdam and Rome.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The Prussian Government has ordered that there shall be no public
festivities on the occasion of the birthday of the
<span class="smcap">Kaiser</span>. This confirms the rumour that
<span class="smcap">His Majesty</span> now wishes that he had not been
born.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>By the way, to show how far-reaching is the influence of a Prussian
command even to-day, no public festivities will take place on the
occasion referred to either in Belgium, France, Russia, Japan, Serbia,
Montenegro, or Great Britain.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Dernburg</span>&mdash;and the expression is
really not a bit too strong for him&mdash;has been telling an American
audience that his countrymen really "love the French and the
Belgians." At the risk of appearing ungrateful, however, our allies
are saying that the Germans have such a subtle way of showing their
love that they would rather be hated, please.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>"Germany," says the <i>Cologne Gazette</i> in an article on the
food question, "has still at hand a very large supply of pigs." Even
after the enormous number they have exported to Belgium.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Meanwhile we are constantly assured that the food question causes
no anxiety whatever in Germany. It certainly does seem, judging by the
lies with which the Germans are fed, that these wonderful people will
be able to swallow anything.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Lord <span class="smcap">Rosebery's</span> appointment as
Captain-General of the Royal Company of Scottish Archers has not
escaped the notice of the alert German Press, and it is being pointed
out in Berlin that we are so hard up in the matter of equipment for
our army that bows and arrows are now being served out.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The new corps which has just been formed with the title of the
"Ju-Jitsu Corps" has, we are informed, no connection with the artistes
who went to the Front to give entertainments for the troops.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Both officers and men in certain towns are beginning to complain of
the irksomeness of the constant salutes that have to be given when
they walk abroad. Surely it should be possible to invent some simple
little contrivance whereby a button is pressed and a mechanical hand
does the rest?</p>

<p>Suggested name for a regiment of Bantams&mdash;The Miniature Rifles.</p>

<p>A peculiarly touching instance of patriotism has been brought to
our notice. A London barber whose measurements are too puny to allow
of his being accepted as a recruit has written to the War Office
offering to barb some wire for them in his spare time.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>"Mr. <span class="smcap">Keir Hardie</span>," says a bulletin, "was
yesterday reported to be gradually improving." But we are afraid that
this only refers to his health.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>An Englishman had suddenly to exercise all his tact the other day.
He was in Kensington Gardens with a Belgian refugee. "What's that?" he
asked, pointing to the Albert Memorial. The Englishman explained.
"What, already a monument to our brave King!" cried the Belgian as he
embraced his friend. The Englishman, with admirable reticence, said
nothing.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>"A Turkish advance guard," says a telegram, "has occupied Tabriz."
Very plucky of him, and his name ought to be published. Can it be dear
old Turkish Reggie?</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The <i>Vorw&auml;rts</i> computes that the War is costing nine
millions a day. Small wonder if, in these hard times, one or two
countries look upon war as a luxury which they ought to try to get on
without.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>"As there is every probability," we read, "that the child
population of Kensington will decline in the future owing to the
migration of families to the outer suburbs, the L.C.C. proposes to
meet the present demand for a new school by building a 'short-life
school,' one that will last but twenty years." The difficulty, of
course, will be so to construct it that it will collapse gently on the
last day of its twentieth year, and the problem threatens to tax to
the utmost the ingenuity of our jerry-builders.</p>

<hr />

<p>During a "stormy scene" in Stirling School Board, Councillor
<span class="smcap">Barker</span>, according to <i>The Glasgow Evening
Times</i>, "refused to withdraw, alleging that Mr. Reid taunted him on
the streets as being an Alpine Purist." "Alpine purist" is a term of
abuse with which <i>Mr. Punch</i> has never sullied his lips, though
once he nearly referred to a very tedious bishop as a cis-Carpathian
pedagogue.</p>

<h3 class="sans">NOTICE.</h3>

<p>The advertisement which appeared in our last week's issue, opposing
the principle of the inoculation of soldiers against typhoid, came in
very late, and unfortunately its contents were not submitted to the
Secretary, who was merely told of the source from which it
came&mdash;namely, the Anti-Vivisection Society. <i>Mr. Punch</i> is
himself absolutely in favour of inoculation against typhoid for the
troops.</p>

<h2 class="sans">A FORCED MARCH.</h2>

<p>Petherby recommended route-marching; said he used to suffer from
sensations of repletion after heavy meals, just as I did, but, after a
series of Saturday afternoons spent in route-marching through our
picturesque hill country (Herne, Brixton, Denmark and so forth), the
distressing symptoms completely vanished, and he now felt as right as
a trivet.</p>

<p>I hadn't a ghost of a notion what a trivet was, nor yet what degree
of rectitude was expected of it; but I nevertheless determined to try
the route-march cure. Bismuth and pepsin should henceforth be drugs in
the market as far as I was concerned. The only doubt in my mind was
whether, technically speaking, I could perform a route-march all by
myself. Somehow I thought etiquette demanded the presence of a band,
or at any rate a drum and fife <i>obbligato</i>. But Petherby thought
not, and declared it would prove just as effective rendered as a solo.
"Besides," he added, "if you want music to invigorate you, you can
whistle or hum. Moreover, you can switch the music on or off at
will."</p>

<p>I resolved to start the treatment the following Saturday afternoon,
and certainly should have done so but for the weather, which was very
moist. If there's one thing I hate more than dyspepsia it's
rheumatism. The next Saturday was fine&mdash;fine for a Saturday, that is;
but a well-meant gift of tickets for a <i>matin&eacute;e</i>, which it
would have been churlish of me to refuse, robbed me of my prospective
enjoyment. However, Saturday of the week after was also fine. Nothing
stood in the way of my pleasurable tramp, and I determined to
route-march home from the City.</p>

<p>I spent two hours in ill-concealed impatience&mdash;the marker told me
he had never seen me put up such a poor game&mdash;waiting to see if the
weather would change. But as at the expiration of that time it had
apparently got stuck I decided to risk it.</p>

<p>Softly humming to myself, "Here we are again," I route-marched out
of the hotel into Bishopsgate in fine style, and got on to a bus bound
for the Bank (I did this to save time). Arrived at the Bank I took
another bus to Blackfriars (I did this to save more time. I thought it
would be nice to commence the march from the Embankment). When I
reached Blackfriars I remembered that all the big walks started from
the political end, so as I did not wish to assume any superiority
which I did not strictly possess I took the tram to Westminster. There
I alighted and was about to set off over Westminster Bridge when it
occurred to me that I hadn't had any tea. To route-march on an empty
stomach was, I felt sure, the height of folly. I therefore repaired to
a tea-shop in the vicinity, where I encountered young Pilkington. We
discussed <span class="smcap">Kitchener</span> and crumpets, training
and tea, the <span class="smcap">Kaiser</span> and cake, and with a
little adroitness I managed to bring in the subject of the medicinal
value of route-marching. When I rose to go Pilkington inquired my
destination.</p>

<p>"Norbury," I told him.</p>

<p>"That's lucky," he said; "I shall be able to give you a lift in a
taxi as far as Kennington."</p>

<p>In vain I expostulated with him, and urged that I was
route-marching, not route-cabbing. But he wouldn't listen.</p>

<p>"Anyhow," he concluded, "it's most dangerous to march just after a
crumpet tea. Haven't you read your 'Infantry Training'?"</p>

<p>The upshot of the matter was that we taxied to Kennington, where at
last I managed to leave him. And then I began to feel tired. True, I
hadn't done any marching, but it was none the less true that I felt as
tired as if I had. However, I succeeded in struggling on for about
fifty yards (to the tune of <span class="smcap">Handel's</span>
<i>Largo</i>), and then I boarded a tram. It had only proceeded a
quarter-of-a-mile or so when the current failed and we all had to get
out. I waited half-an-hour for a fresh batch of current to arrive, but
none came, and I realised that my best course would be to walk to
Brixton Station and procure a cab.</p>

<p>Accordingly, to the melody of "I don't expect to do it again for
months and months and months," I put my best foot foremost. It was a
moot point which of my two feet merited this distinction; they both
felt deplorably senile. Then it began to rain&mdash;no mere niggardly
sprinkling, but a lavish week-end cataclysm. I reached the station in
the condition known to chemists as a saturated solution, only to find
that there was not a cab on the rank. I was therefore compelled to
adopt the only means of transport left to me&mdash;to route-march
home....</p>

<p>I ultimately staggered in at my gate at an advanced hour of the
evening to the strains of the opening bars of
<span class="smcap">Tschaikowsky's</span> Pathetic Symphony, whistled
mentally. I was far beyond making the actual physical effort.</p>

<p>That night I wrote a postcard to Petherby. It ran as
follows:&mdash;"Have just completed your course of treatment. Am
cured."</p>

<p>Grave and serene, though young at heart,</p>

</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>His choir, like every singing school,</p>
<p class="i2">By turns angelic and demonic,</p>

<p>For contact with so rare a mind</p>
<p class="i2">Has seldom failed to spur and raise them,</p>

<p>Withal he knows that human boys</p>

<p class="i2">Himself at seasons of unbending;</p>
<p>A diet of perpetual Psalms</p>

<p>And so he varies <span class="smcap">Bach</span> and

<p class="i2">With simple tunes and rousing chanties.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>His taste is catholic and sane;</p>

<p>Madingley is one of those men who are always asking you to do
things for them. He will send you cheerfully on the top of a bus from
the City to Hammersmith to buy tobacco for him at a particular little
shop, and if you point out that he could do it much better in his own
car, he says reproachfully that the car is only used for business
purposes. (If so, he must have a good deal of business at Walton

mind asking him&mdash;&mdash;" And somehow you can't refuse. He beams at you

<p>However, it was apparently to tell me news that he came to see me
the other day.</p>

<p>"I'm horribly busy," he said. "The fact is I'm going to
enlist."</p>

<p>"They won't take you," I said. "You're blind."</p>

<p>"Not so blind as you are."</p>

<p>"Put it that we're both blind, and that our King and Country want
neither of us."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm not so sure. There are lots of people with spectacles in
the Army."</p>

<p>"And lots of flies in amber," I said, "but nobody seems to know how
they came there."</p>

<p>Then Madingley got to business. His partner, who had enlisted in
August, had developed lung trouble and had returned to civil life.
Madingley was now free to go. He had heard from a friend that the
121st Rifles (a Territorial Regiment) had no conscientious objections
to spectacles. Would I&mdash;(I thought it must be coming)&mdash;would I go and
find out for him? He gave me the address of their head-quarters.</p>

<p>"You see I'm so horribly busy, old chap&mdash;clearing up at the office,
and so on."</p>

<p>Well, of course I had to. Madingley's attitude of pained
forgiveness, if one refuses him anything, is more than I can bear.
Alter all, it didn't seem very much to do.</p>

<p>I began with the sentry outside.</p>

<p>"Can you tell me&mdash;&mdash;" I said pleasantly. He scowled and jerked his
head towards the door. I went in and tried another man. "Can you tell
me&mdash;&mdash;" I began. "Enlist?" he said. "Upstairs." I went upstairs and
pushed open a door. "Can you tell me&mdash;&mdash;" I said. "This is the
canteen," answered a man in an apron....</p>

<p>At last I found a sergeant. "Enlist?" he said briskly. "Come in." I
went in.</p>

<p>He leant against a table and I smiled at him pleasantly.</p>

<p>"I just wanted to ask," I said, "whether&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Quite so," he said, and gave me a long explanation of what my pay
would be now that I had decided to join the Army. He began with the
one and a penny of a private and was working up towards the stipend of
a Field Marshal when I stopped him.</p>

<p>"One moment&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Exactly," he said. "You're married."</p>

<p>"Y&mdash;yes," I said. "At least, no," I added, thinking of
Madingley.</p>

<p>"Surely you know?" he asked in surprise.</p>

<p>I remembered suddenly the penalty for a false declaration. It would
be no good explaining afterwards that I meant Madingley.</p>

<p>"Yes," I said. "Married."</p>

<p>He told me what my separation allowance would be.... As a married
Field Marshal with three children it came to &mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<p>I decided to be firm.</p>

<p>"Er&mdash;I mustn't trouble you too much," I said. "I really only wanted
to know if you take men with spectacles."</p>

<p>"Depends how short-sighted you are. Do you always wear them?"</p>

<p>"No, but I ought to really." I made a desperate effort to get
Madingley back into the conversation. "I really only came to find out
for a&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah, well, the best thing you can do," said the sergeant, "is to
pass the medical examination first. You can sign the papers
afterwards. Come along."</p>

<p>I followed him meekly downstairs. It was obviously not Madingley's
afternoon.</p>

<p>We plunged downstairs into what was no doubt the anti-Zeppelin
cellar. Through the gloom I saw dimly two or three pink-and-white
figures waiting their turn to be thumped. Down the throat of a man in
the middle of the room a doctor was trying to climb. Mechanically I
began to undo my tie.</p>

<p>The sergeant spoke to one of the doctors and then came back to
me.</p>

<p>"It'll save time if we do your sight first," he said. "Stand over
in this corner."</p>

<p>I stood in the corner....</p>

<p>For a long time nothing happened.</p>

<p>"Well?" said the sergeant impatiently.</p>

<p>"Well?" I said.</p>

<p>"Why don't you read?"</p>

<p>"What? Have we begun?" I asked in surprise. I couldn't see
anything.</p>

<p>The medical officer came over to me and in a friendly way put his
hand over my left eye. It didn't help much, but I spotted where he
came from, and gathered that the card must be in that direction.
Gradually it began to loom through the blackness.</p>

<p>"Wait a moment," I said. I removed his hand and gazed keenly at the
opposite wall. "That's a B," I announced proudly. "That top one."</p>

<p>The doctor and the sergeant looked at each other.</p>

<p>"It's no good," sighed the sergeant.</p>

<p>"He can't even read the first two lines," groaned the doctor.</p>

<p>"It's all very well for you two," I broke in indignantly; "one of
you lives down here and is used to it, and the other knows the card by
heart. I haven't come to enlist for night operations only. Surely your
regiment does things in the daylight sometimes?"</p>

<p>The doctor, only knowing about the daylight by hearsay, looked
blank; the sergeant repeated sadly, "Not even the first two
lines."</p>

<p>"Look here," I said, "lend me the card to-night and I'll come again
to-morrow. If it's only two lines you want, I think I can promise you
them."</p>

<p>The doctor said mournfully that he might lend me the card, but that
in that case it would be his painful duty to put up a different card
for me on the next day.</p>

<p>There seemed to be nothing more to say. I was about to go when a
face which I recognised emerged from the gloom. It had a shirt
underneath it and then legs. The face began to grin at me.</p>

<p>"Hallo," said a voice.</p>

<p>"Hallo, Rogers," I said; "<i>you</i> enlisting? I thought you
couldn't get leave." Rogers is in the Civil Service, and his work is
supposed to be important.</p>

<p>"Well, I haven't exactly got leave&mdash;yet," he said awkwardly. "The
fact is, I just came here to ask about a commission for a friend, and
while I was here I&mdash;er&mdash;suddenly decided to risk it. You know
Madingley, by the way, don't you?"</p>

<p>"I used to think so," I said.</p>

<p>But now I see that there is more in Madingley than I thought. His
job in this war is simple&mdash;and exactly suited to himself. By
arrangement with the War Office he sends likely recruits to make
enquiries for him&mdash;and the sergeant does the rest.</p>

<h2 class="sans">THE INVASION.</h2>

<p>Between Mortimer and us yawns a great gulf, bridged by many flights
of stairs. Even on the illuminated board at the foot of the lowest
stairs we still keep our distance, but with this difference, that
while Mortimer's position in the world is higher than mine, on the
board I stand above him by as many names as there are stairs between
us.</p>

<p>Mortimer first floated into my orbit one day when we both met in
the porter's lodge to complain about the dustbin. Even after this I
should have gone contentedly down to my grave with no further
knowledge of the man than that he had a wife and four children. I knew
that because I heard him tell the porter so.</p>

<p>One evening after dinner&mdash;it seems now many moons ago&mdash;Clara, our
lady-help, threw open the drawing-room door and in startled tones
announced Mr. and Mrs. Mortimer. Prompt to the word of command in they
marched, followed by the four youthful Mortimers. Each of these latter
clutched a sponge-bag and an elusive bundle of flannel, and in the
background loomed the Mortimer maid-of-all-work.</p>

<p>Mortimer began to talk immediately and said that of course we had
seen the War Office order that on the first sound of guns all
Londoners were to make for the cellars. Mrs. Mortimer was certain she
had heard firing and that the Zeppelin raid had begun, so, like good
citizens, the family had hastened to comply with the regulations.</p>

<p>"We shan't put you to any inconvenience," said Mortimer volubly.
"The children can curl up in the spare room and my wife and I will do
with a shake-down in the passage. In time of war one must be prepared
for discomfort. Think of the poor fellows in the trenches."</p>

<p>Here Mrs. Mortimer murmured something inarticulate.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, of course," Mortimer assented, "Emma must be made
comfortable." All this time my wife and I had not been able to say a
word, Mortimer's plausibility and the spectacle of the four little
Mortimers and their sponge-bags having robbed us of speech and
thought. Jane was the first to find her voice, and managed to gasp out
that we had heard no guns.</p>

<p>"You wouldn't, of course, in the&mdash;er&mdash;down here," said Mortimer. I
was glad to notice him hesitate this time over the word "cellar" as
applied to our artistic home.</p>

<p>"I know exactly what you are thinking," he went on kindly; "it is
embarrassing to discuss household arrangements in public," and with a
flourish of his arm, he marshalled his family and swept them out of
the room, carefully shutting the door behind him.</p>

<p>Jane and I gazed awestruck at each other.</p>

<p>"We can't turn them away," said my wife. "Those five pairs of eyes
would haunt me all night (Mortimer's and Emma's were, I presume, the
ones omitted), and if the Zeppelins <i>did</i> come to-night how awful
we should feel."</p>

<p>"We must be firm about it being only for to-night, then," I said.
"We must consider Kate." (Kate is our cat.)</p>

<p>So it was arranged that we should give up our room and that Emma
should share with Clara. I found the Mortimer family sitting in a
crowded row on the antique bench in the hall, like players at
dumb-crambo waiting for the word. Briefly I told them it was "stay."
They all jumped up; Mortimer shook me cordially by the hand, and I
believe Mrs. Mortimer kissed my wife.</p>

<p>True to the compact the refugees departed next morning, and we saw
the last little Mortimer disappear upwards with unmixed relief. They
were all back again, however, the following evening, this time
encumbered with more articles towards "camping out." The expression
was Mortimer's, not mine.</p>

<p>On the fourth evening Mortimer took me aside and told me
confidentially that he could see this state of things was telling on
us as much as on them, and that he thought the best plan would be for
our two households to "chum together" while the Zeppelin menace
lasted. (What fool said the war was going to last three years?) Never
waiting for a reply, Mortimer went on to say that it really would not
be so much trouble as it seemed at the first shock. He and I would be
out all day, which would even up the numbers, and Emma would, of
course, help. I much resented being estimated as equal to
three-and-a-half Mortimers and had no delusions about Emma's
helpfulness, but Mortimer's volubility had its usual stupefying
effect. He carried the motion to his own satisfaction, and my wife
told me that I behaved like an idiot.</p>

<p>We stood three days of this lunatic <i>m&eacute;nage</i>. Every
evening on returning from office I found more alien belongings
blocking up my home. Mortimer boots strewed the scullery, their coats
smothered the hat-stand, their toothbrushes filled the bathroom. Clara
is a noble-hearted girl, but there was menace in her glance, and my
wife was ageing before my eyes. Kate too had left us.</p>

<p>On the third evening when I came home I found a note sticking in
the hall clothes-brush. "Meet me in the pantry," it said. I flew to
the rendezvous, where Jane received me with her finger on her lip.
Dragging me in, she managed with difficulty to close the door&mdash;our
pantry is what you might call bijou&mdash;and, leaning against the sink,
she unburdened her mind.</p>

<p>"I have an idea," she hissed. "Overcome by superior numbers, <i>we
must</i> evacuate the position. Better one Zeppelin once than six
Mortimers for ever. Let us take possession of their flat, as they have
of ours."</p>

<p>It was a masterly and superb idea, worthy of the brain from which
it sprang. We hastened to impart it to the Mortimers, who were sitting
over the drawing-room fire reading my evening paper. They were much
touched. Mortimer said he should never forgive himself if we were
killed by bombs, and Mrs. Mortimer said it made all the difference our
not having children.</p>

<p>We have now been settled for some time in Mortimer's flat, and in
many ways prefer it to our own; in fact we shall be quite content to
remain here as long as Mortimer continues to pay the rent. We found
Kate already installed. The sagacious animal evidently adds prophetic
instinct to her other gifts. When she makes a decided move downstairs
we shall prepare for hostile aircraft.</p>

<h2 class="sans">THE SAD CASE OF SEBASTIAN PILNING.</h2>

<p class="title">A Summer Memory.</p>

<p>I removed my face hurriedly from a large tumbler of iced
never-mind-what.</p>

<p>"Good heavens, Henry!" I cried, "you don't mean to say you've been
weeding the grass!"</p>

<p>"It wasn't my own idea," he pleaded; "it was Sonia who put me up to
it. She said that now Baby was beginning to notice things it was quite
time something was done to the lawn&mdash;don't snort, we always call it
the lawn at home&mdash;or he would grow up to think badly of his father. I
had a shot at it yesterday, but there's a good bit more to do. Look
here," he continued, brightening, "drop round to-morrow and let Sonia
find you a chisel or something. It's not bad fun really. All the
excitement of the chase and no danger to life or limb."</p>

<p>"Not for worlds," I replied solemnly, "You jest at the dangers of
weeding, but I have seen something of the misery it involves. Listen,
I am going to tell you a story.</p>

<p>"Once upon a time I chanced to know a man called Pilning, Sebastian
Pilning. Like you, he was blessed with a young wife and the beginning
of a family; like you, he was a quiet, unambitious fellow of simple
tastes. Moreover, he was incredibly stubborn.  One idle spring morning
he sauntered out into his back garden to smoke a pipe, and it chanced
that for the first time in his life he took a good look at his&mdash;yes,
he, called it a lawn too. I need not tell you what he saw there. It
was like most lawns, four blades of grass and the rest one vast
expanse of weeds. For a moment he was staggered.</p>

<p>"And then the little devil that lies in wait for men who go out to
look at their back-gardens whispered in his ear, 'You've nothing to
do, Pilning, why not have a few of these weeds out?' It was his first
temptation, and he fell.</p>

<p>"All that day he toiled at his lawn, and by the evening there was a
patch about three feet square that looked like a fragment of a
ploughed field. On this he sprinkled grass seed and fortified it with
wire entanglements to keep out the birds. The next morning he was at
it again, and so he continued for three whole weeks. At the end of
that time the disease had taken a firm hold of him. He had managed to
clear most of his plot, but only the finest grass would satisfy him
now; he had begun to root up the coarser quality and the blades that
didn't seem to him to be quite the right shade. He worked incessantly,
and his wife had to bring his meals out to him. He even attempted to
sleep out there in a hammock, so that he could start the first thing
in the morning. He had an idea that the weeds would be rooted up more
readily if he could catch them asleep. But it rained the first night
he tried, and that put him off, because he knew that if his health
broke down the dandelions would get the upper hand. He became so
strange at last that one day his wife sent round and begged me to come
and see him."</p>

<p>"Did you tell him one of your stories?" asked Henry.</p>

<p>"I found him in the garden on his knees stabbing at a plantain with
a corkscrew. He had marked the whole place out in squares like a
chess-board, each square representing a day's work and a pound of
grass seed sown. The word had been passed round that free meals were
going at Pilning's, and every sparrow in the district was there. They
seemed to appreciate the system of wire entanglements: it showed them
where to look for seeds.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page50" id="page50"></a>[pg 50]</span></p>

<p>"I could see at a glance that Pilning was in a bad way. He spoke
cheerfully enough, but there was a nasty look in his eyes. I tried to
lead him off gradually to safer topics by interesting him in the less
perilous delights of flower-growing. I asked after his gerania and
spoke with admiration of his aspidistra and his jasponyx...."</p>

<p>"Rot!" said Henry. "That's a mineral."</p>

<p>"Sorry&mdash;my fault. It's such a jolly word, and I didn't think you'd
know any better.... But it was all in vain; he would talk of nothing
but grass and weeds. I tried to comfort his wife as I left, but my
heart was very heavy. That night, Henry, the blow fell! They managed
to lure Pilning in to dinner when it got dusk, but his mind was
wandering a lot. Finally he broke down completely, and made a
desperate assault with a toothpick on the baby's scalp. His wife
fetched one of the neighbours to sit on his head while she went for
the doctor; but it was too late. His reason had become utterly
unhinged. There was nothing for it but to put him away in a home, and
there he has remained for five long years.</p>

<p>"Only last week I went to ask how he was, and the doctor said there
was no change, but that he was quite harmless. I was shown into a
little room where he lived, and there I saw him on the floor talking
and laughing to himself. But he took no notice of me when I spoke to
him. They told me he was quite happy and would spend hours a day like
that at his work."</p>

<p>"What sort of work?" asked Henry.</p>

<p>"The last time I saw poor Pilning," I replied sadly, "he was
squatting on the carpet and trying to jab the pattern out with a
fork."</p>

<h2 class="sans">A TERRITORIAL IN INDIA.</h2>

<p class="title1">I.</p>

<p>My dear <i>Mr. Punch</i>,&mdash;We take special pride in the fact that
we were the very first Territorials ever to land in India. As our
battalion swung through the streets of Bombay before the critical eyes
of the assembled natives, this knowledge enabled us to preserve an air
of dignity despite the rakish angle of our unaccustomed topees. When
you first march at attention with a rifle and a very large helmet you
discover that the only possible position for the latter is well over
the right ear. Later on you realise that this is a mistake, like most
of the discoveries made during the first few days' residence in
India.</p>

<p>On that memorable day, of which our battalion poet has
written&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem width21"><div class="stanza">
<p>"O day of pride and perspiration,</p>
<p class="i2">When, 'scaping from the dreary sea,</p>
<p>We marched full blithely to our station</p>
<p class="i2">And filled ourselves with eggs and tea&mdash;"</p>
</div></div>

<p>we were eight hundred strong, having spent thirty-two days in a
transport and passed through all the salutary trials of inoculation,
vaccination and starvation with considerable <i>&eacute;clat</i>. Now,
alas! we are decimated. Decimated, did I say? Far, far worse than
that. We are practically wiped out.</p>

<p>No, there has not been a second Mutiny, concealed by the
newspapers. We have not perished of malaria. Nor have we been eaten by
white ants. Even the last-named would be a glorious, an inspiring end
compared with the fate which has overtaken us.</p>

<p>You remember how, many years ago, you used to sit with your
infantile tongue protruding from the left-hand corner of your mouth
and write in a fair round hand, "<i>The pen is mightier than the
sword</i>." At that time you disbelieved it. But you were wrong. It is
true, sadly true.</p>

<p>A few days after our arrival we were reviewed by the G.O.C. In
eloquent words he told us that we were not in India for garrison work,
but to be trained speedily for the Front, to be fitted to play our
part on the great battlefields of Europe. Inspiring visions of
military glory rose before us. Later in the day they began to
evaporate. They have been evaporating ever since.</p>

<p>Owing to the departure of the Expeditionary Forces there has been
a great shortage of soldier clerks in India, and the luckless
Territorials who had the misfortune to arrive first have been called
upon to fill the vacancies. <i>Ichabod.</i></p>

<p>When the announcement that clerks were required was made to us my
blood ran suddenly cold. I remembered how, centuries ago, when in camp
on Salisbury Plain, I had been requested to fill up a form giving,
among other particulars, my occupation, and light-heartedly and
truthfully I had written "Clerk." It is a great mistake to be truthful
in the Army. How I wished I had described myself as an agricultural
labourer. Or a taxidermist&mdash;surely there is no demand, for
taxidermists in the Indian Army.</p>

<p>In a vain attempt to remedy the mistake I preserved a stony silence
when we were asked who had had clerical experience, who could do
type-writing, who possessed a knowledge of shorthand. With a single
lift of my right eyebrow I disclaimed all acquaintance with office
stools. With a faint pucker of the brows I made myself appear to be
wondering where I had once heard that word typewriter. But my fatal
incriminating declaration was too great a handicap.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page54" id="page54"></a>[pg 54]</span></p>
<p>By threes and fours our brave fellows melted away. They went as
clerks; they went as typists; they went as telephone operators; they
went as telegraphists. To the Battalion Orderly Room they went; to the
Brigade Headquarters Office; to the Embarcation Office.</p>

<p>Then came a lull, and I thought, after all, I had escaped. I arose
happily at 5.30 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> I did many various and
strenuous fatigues. I swept the barrack floor singing and peeled
potatoes with a joyful heart. I polished my equipment incessantly and
greased my mess tin with the greatest care. In short, I was rapidly
becoming a soldier.</p>

<p>And I obtained leave and went into the town, where I saw much that
cheered me while the clerks were at their labours. I read a sign in a
restaurant window, "Breakfast, tiffin, tea, dinner and all kinds of
perfumery." I saw six coolies running along a main street with a grand
piano balanced on their heads. I was very happy while it lasted.</p>

<p>And then the blow fell. We had thought that surely every possible
office had been filled with clerks, but we were wrong as usual. As I
was going to bed one night there came a peremptory order that I was to
be at the Divisional Staff Office, four miles away, sharp at eight
o'clock next morning.</p>

<p>In conformity with my instructions I went forth next morning to
take up my new and peaceful avocation in full marching order, with
rifle, side-arm and twenty rounds of ball ammunition.</p>

<p>Being a soldier clerk in India is very different from being a
civilian clerk in England. Here I work in shirt-sleeves, khaki shorts
and puttees, pausing occasionally to brush off the ants which crawl
affectionately over my knees. At home&mdash;well, I can imagine the Chief's
face if a clerk (or an ant) ventured into his office with bare
knees.</p>

<p>Also the methods adopted here are not like our impetuous English
ways. Operations are carried out with a leisured dignity befitting the
immemorial East. Take a telegram for example. At home the Chief says
rapidly, "Send a wire to So-and-so telling him this-and-that." A
harassed clerk snatches off the telephone-receiver, and in two minutes
the message is dictated to the post-office and the incident is
closed.</p>

<p>Not so here. A document comes out of the Records Department three
days old, having been duly headed, numbered, summarised and indexed.
The clerk to whom it is handed thinks it advisable to wire a reply, so
he writes at the foot, "Wire So-and-so, telling him this-and-that?"
initials it and sends it to the Chief. The Chief writes, "Yes,
please," initials it and sends it back. The clerk then drafts the
actual telegram, initials the draft and sends it to the Chief, who, if
he approves, initials it and sends it back. The draft is next handed
to a second clerk, who, after due consideration, types two copies and
initials them. These are taken to the Chief, who signs them and sends
them back. One copy is filed and the other goes to a third clerk, who
enters it <i>verbatim</i> into a book and has the book initialled by
clerk No. 1, after checking. Then it goes to a fourth clerk, who
numbers it, makes a <i>pr&eacute;cis</i> in another book, and hands
it, with explanations, to a <i>patli wallah</i>, who takes it outside
to an orderly, who conveys it (with unhasting dignity) to the
post-office.</p>

<p>A correspondent asks us what exactly are the duties of the marines.
We have not space to give him an exhaustive account of the work of

<blockquote><p>
"One notable case in which a decoration was bestowed was of a young
seaman, who at tremendous risk to himself, freed a submarine from a

<h2 class="sans">THE ENTERTAINERS.</h2>

<p>I feel that I am entitled to speak with perfect freedom of the
entertainment lately given in our parish hall, for, except as a
spectator and as contributing several of the performers to the
programme, without myself knowing anything about it beyond what rumour
and the unwonted bustling mystery of the household brought to my
knowledge&mdash;except, as I say, in these points, I had nothing to do with
it. The whole thing was managed by an informal committee of ladies,
acting on the discovery that the School Children's Meals Fund was at
its last gasp, and required replenishment in order to carry it on
through the ensuing year. Upon that the informal committee got to work
and held several meetings. Now the methods of a committee of ladies
differ from those of men. The ladies meet together in drawing-rooms
and, so far as a casual observer can judge, they discuss every subject
except the particular one for which they have been summoned. Then
comes the moment when they intimate to one another that they must go,
and they arise and draw slowly and reluctantly out from the
drawing-room through the hall to the front-door step. Then, but never
till then, just as they are about to go away, they suddenly remember
what they came for, and in another five minutes the whole business is
settled, and they stream away with the consciousness of work
satisfactorily done. It is an unceremonious method, but a highly
efficient one if judged by its results. In this particular case it
produced a delightful entertainment, which I may describe as being by
the children, for the children and of the children, as well as of the
elders who gathered together to applaud the zeal and skill of the
little performers.</p>

<p>Fortunately the appointed day was fine and there was a great rush
of spectators, who soon filled the hall to its utmost capacity. The
entertainment began with a tribute to patriotism in the shape of
<i>tableaux vivants</i>, all save one selected from the storehouse of
our kind old friend <i>Mr. Punch's</i> cartoons. There, brilliantly
and magnificently accoutred, was seen Britannia setting out to war for
friendship and honour. There again we beheld brave little Belgium
defying the German bully, and Holland succouring the refugees, and
Belgium consoled by Liberty, and a final picture of Liberty blessing
the Allies. All these were admirably represented, the immobility of
the performers being not less remarkable than the splendour of their
equipment; and enthusiasm was still further stimulated by the singing
of the anthems of the various allied nations.</p>

<p>The performance proceeded, and the <i>intermezzi</i> had been
briskly taken; the harp had spent its last liquid notes; "Caller
Herrin'" had been delightfully sung, and four tiny girls (combined
height some twelve feet) had charmed us with the pretty innocence of
their flower carol. Also a dramatic version of "The Holly Tree Inn"
had been played in a fashion that <span class="smcap">Dickens</span>
would not have disapproved. Now there was a murmur of expectation
among the audience; soon the crystal-clear strains of "He shall feed
His flock" sounded through the room, and as they lingered and died
away the curtain rose for the masque, "The Holy Night." At the back of
the stage was a lowly shed, its closed door guarded by two angelic
figures clothed in pure white draperies and with wings that sparkled
with a silver sheen. High above, to the left of the shed, a third
angel soared, and these three watched and waited, intent and
motionless, their hands crossed over their breasts. In front of them
lay three shepherds, and amongst them frisked a white and woolly
little lamb (Douglas, the Vicar's son), and further to the left we
recognised little Kit Price as a raven in sleek black satin, and our
John only partially disguised as a highly-coloured and effective cock,
strutting and flapping and pecking and scraping to his heart's
content, and admitted to the cast in spite of the stage directions,
which declare that "if any little boy have very fat legs he shall not
play the part of the cock." He made such amends as were possible by
the extreme vividness and energy of the beak with which he kept the
raven in order. At the back of the scene there were vague indications
of the presence of an ox and an ass. It had been intended to represent
them in a lifelike fashion by two heads; but these, though ordered,
had failed to arrive, being cut off on their way by floods.</p>

<p>Now the shepherds burst into song, and when that was over the cock
flapped his wings and crew, and the raven cawed, and the lamb ba-a-ed,
and the uncompleted ox and ass made noises after their kind, and there
was a lively bustle everywhere, except where the angels watched and
waited with their hands crossed and their shining wings at rest. The
shepherds began to gossip as shepherds, I suppose, have gossiped ever
since the care of sheep began. One told how his grandam said, on the
authority of a wise woman, that on the night Messias is born all the
beasts shall speak. Another doubted whether this would hap in our
time. Nothing, he thought, would hap save these heavy taxings; but the
other reminded him that it had been a good year for sheep. But
suddenly, as the shepherds chatted, the three angels, invisible to the
shepherds, raised each a warning hand and bent forward and whispered,
"Hush-sh!" and an awe-struck silence fell upon the scene. Something
great and wonderful had happened, but what was it, and how would it be
revealed?</p>

<p>Thereupon the cock, flapping his wings, did not crow, but cried
out, "<i>Christus natus est!</i> Christ is born!" and the raven,
instead of cawing, called "<i>Quando?</i> When?" and the ass in a loud
voice answered, "<i>Hac nocte!</i> This night!" and the ox said
"<i>Ubi?</i> Where?" and the lamb stood up and bleated
"Be-e-ethlehem." Oh, then was heard a swelling sound of great
exultation, and above the shed the dark and starry skies were opened
and drawn away to each side, and there were disclosed angels raised up
and standing in a long row, their bright wings folded and pointing
upward, while they declared the glory of the Lord. And next the two
guarding angels folded back the door of the shed, and there were seen
<span class="smcap">Mary</span> and <span class="smcap">Joseph</span>,
"and betwixt them two"&mdash;I quote from the directions&mdash;"the Holy Child
lieth on a tuft of straw in a little box which shall be called the
Manger," while two diminutive angels knelt, one at each side of the
open door. No more beautiful and gracious picture could be imagined.
Thus might some old Italian master have painted it, but this had, not
colour alone and simplicity, but life and song and jubilation and
perfect harmony of movement so natural as to seem unstudied. Then the
shepherds did obeisance and the Wise Men,
<span class="smcap">Melchior</span>, <span class="smcap">Caspar</span>
and <span class="smcap">Balthasar</span>, came and offered their
gifts, and, last, after preparations had been made for departure into
Egypt, the whole company sang together the glorious and triumphant
"<i>Adeste, Fideles</i>," and the curtain drew down and the beautiful
masque was over. There was no applause&mdash;only a universal sigh of
contentment and admiration.</p>

<h2>THE ERROR.</h2>

<p>It was on Monday, January 11, 1915. He had been reading <i>The
Daily Mail</i> and suddenly he banged it down. "You can't believe what
you see in the papers," he said.</p>

<p>"Since when?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I suppose always," he said, "but particularly to-day."</p>

<p>He was a nice young soldier on his way back to his camp after a
holiday, and I guessed him, before he enlisted in
<span class="smcap">Kitchener's</span> army, to have been a provincial
clerk or a salesman of some kind.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said; "and I know someone else who'll say the same when
she sees it."</p>

<p>"Sees what?" I asked.</p>

<p>He found a paragraph in the paper&mdash;towards the foot of the Society
column&mdash;and placed his thumb on it.</p>

<p>"This," he said.</p>

<p>"Mayn't I see?" I asked.</p>

<p>He kept his thumb there.</p>

<p>"Yes, and her mother will have something to say to it too," he went
on, "and"&mdash;he chuckled richly&mdash;"my mother too. The idea!"</p>

<p>"Mayn't I see it?" I asked again.</p>

<p>"As if nobody in this world mattered but toffs," he said. "Perhaps
they did once; but they're not going to for ever, I can tell you."</p>

<p>"You're a Socialist?" I suggested.</p>

<p>"No, I'm not," he said. "I don't hold with Socialism. But I'm sure
after this war's over toffs aren't going to be quite everything that
they were before it began.</p>

<p>"The cheek of it!" he continued, with another glance at the paper.
"Lumme, I'd like to be there when she lets herself go!"</p>

<p>"Your mother?" I said.</p>

<p>"No, I didn't mean her just then; but she'd be all right to listen
to, too. She can't half speak her mind! No, I meant my fiancy. I've
just left her; been there for Sunday."</p>

<p>"Have you been engaged long?" I asked.</p>

<p>He laughed. "No," he said. "That's the point. We only got engaged

day that we fixed it up."</p>

<p>"I congratulate you," I said, "and her too. I think she's lucky to
have a soldier for her husband. I hope you're both very happy."</p>

<p>"Happy!" he said; "I should think we were. That's what makes me so
disgusted with this paper. Look at it."</p>

<p>At last he removed his thumb and showed me a paragraph beginning
with the words, "The first interesting engagement of the New Year is
that between Captain Dudley Hornby and Lady Marjorie Feilding."</p>

<p>"The 'first'!" he said scornfully. "The 'first'! She and her mother
on that," he chuckled, "and my mother to help them! (We live close
by). My, I wish I could be there to hear it. Give it me back, please;
I must mark it and post it. What a time they'll have!"</p>

<p>I would like to be there too.</p>

<h2 class="sans">THE BALLYMURKY CONTINGENT.</h2>

<p>"I towld you how the Docthor's War speech sent iv'ry man from
Ballymurky to the war," said old Martin Cassidy to me. "But did I not
tell you how the Widdy O'Grady persuaded Terence Connelly to join
them?</p>

<p>"I did not? Well, well. It all came out the very day the boys were
leaving Ballymurky. Seventeen of them there were no less, and the
Docthor there reviewing them this way and that way till he had you
bewildered with the inthricacies of them.</p>

<p>"''Tis an uneven number you are,' sez he, 'however I look at you,'
sez he.</p>

<p>"'Maybe you'll join us, Mrs. Murphy?' sez he; ''twill not be the
first time you've worn the trousies, good luck to you,' sez he. 'Och
have done wid your banther, Docthor dear,' sez she; 'there's plenty of
them that wears them regler,' sez she, 'in other parts,' sez she.
'You'll not be looking for men in petticoats in Ballymurky,' sez
she.</p>

<p>"Sure 'tis a good thing wars come only once in a while," said old
Martin; "and me there comfortin' Mrs. Doolan. 'He'll come back to you
when the war is over, Mrs. Doolan,' sez I; 'niver fear,' sez I.</p>

<p>"'I know he will,' sez she, wipin' her eyes wid her apron. 'He's
not aisy lost, trust him for that. 'Tis no luck I have at all, at
all,' sez she.</p>

<p>"They went by the express thrain, so they did," continued old
Martin, and went on to explain that very few express trains passed
through Ballymurky without stopping. "Sure isn't it a terminus?" said
he. "Och but 'twas the fine band they had to play them to the station.
Be the way Doolan bate the big dhrum you'd think 'twas the
<span class="smcap">Kaiser's</span> head he was at.</p>

<p>"'Go aisy with her, Doolan,' said the Docthor; 'you're drowning
Patsy's runs on the thrombone,' said he.</p>

<p>"'Twas the beautiful music Patsy was discoursin' on that same
thrombone. He had the way of it&mdash;none betther. 'Twas a gift wid
him.</p>

<p>"The band&mdash;Patsy and Doolan&mdash;headed the procession playing
'Erin-go-bragh'&mdash;at laste Patsy was. And didn't he shtop playing in
the middle of the third verse?</p>

<p>"'What the divvle d'you think you're playing, Doolan?' sez he.</p>

<p>"'Arrah, gwan out o' that,' sez Doolan, bating the big dhrum. ''Tis
all one to me what I play this day,' sez he. 'Gwan you wid your
thrombone,' sez he, 'and lave me extemporise on the big dhrum. 'Tis a
free counthry annyway,' sez he.</p>

<p>"'Twas at Micky's shebeen that they had the first encounther wid
the inimy," said old Martin. "Sure the whole company began to
trimble.</p>

<p>"''Tis  dying with the thirst on me I am,' sez Shemus; 'you could
shtrike a match on me tongue,' sez he.</p>

<p>"'Arrah, go aisy, Docthor dear,' sez Larry; ''tis the cowld has
settled on me stomach,' sez he, 'like a shtone,' sez he.</p>

<p>"But the Docthor was inixorable; he wouldn't lave a man break the
ranks.</p>

<p>"'Double!' sez he&mdash;just that. You should have heard the blasht
Patsy let out of his thrombone. If iver the Docthor gets mintioned in
the despatches you'll find Patsy at his elbow, so you will.</p>

<p>"'Twas ten o'clock the thrain was to shtart, and the Docthor had
them at the station be half-past, punctual to the minyit. Isn't
Terence the guard and hadn't he been blowing his whistle this
half-hour wid the express there stamping her feet to be away? 'Is it
tomorrow you're going, Docthor?' sez he; 'for if  'tis so you'll have
to go be a later thrain,' sez he. ''Tis all I can do to hould her in,'
sez he.</p>

<p>"'Sure 'tis a hurry you are in, Terence,' sez the Docthor; 'and you
wid the nice bright day before you. Seventeen of the best I've brought
you, Terence; I can't make an even number of them count them as I
will. 'Tis hard to see Conlan there forming twos be himself, so it
is.'</p>

<p>"'You're looking younger iv'ry day, Terence me boy,' sez the
Docthor, aisy like. 'What age would you be now?'</p>

<p>"''Tis forty I am, Docthor darlin',' said Terence&mdash;'in me boots,'
sez he.</p>

<p>"''Tis the thick boots you're wearin'; won't you take them off,
Terence?' sez the Docthor. 'What's your chist measurement?' sez
he.</p>

<p>"'Thirty-eight, no less,' sez Terence, expanding of himself to his
full height like a pouther pigeon.</p>

<p>"'I once heard tell of a man that gave his chist measurement be
mistake for his age, Terence. Did you never make a mistake in your
life now, Terence?' sez the Docthor.</p>

<p>"'Did I not, Docthor, and only last night,' said Terence; 'mebbe
you'll hear of it yet,' sez he. 'Gwan out o' that, Docthor, now.'"</p>

<p>"I thought you said that Terence joined them," I remarked.</p>

<p>"Wait now till I tell you," said Martin. "Was I not saying that the
Widdy O'Grady was there? Next to the engine she was, looking out of
the carriage window at the boys. 'Twas goin' part of the way wid them
she was; and why not?</p>

<p>"'You'll be late startin',' said the station-master to Terence,
''tis near eleven o'clock,' sez he; 'or after,' sez he. ''Tis me flag
I'm lookin' for,' sez Terence. 'Sure the signal's against us, anyway,'
sez he.</p>

<p>"''Tis not this thrain the signal refers to,' said the
station-master, ''tis the next thrain. Wave your flag and let her go,
Terence,' sez he.</p>

<p>"But 'twas flusthered Terence was wid losin' his flag," said old
Martin. 'The divvle take the flag,' sez he. 'Sure I'll shtart her wid
me handkerchief,' sez he. A red handkerchief at that," said Martin
Cassidy.</p>

<p>"You'd not expect an engine-dhriver to shtart the thrain be wavin'
a red handkerchief at him&mdash;not an express thrain. Sure he'd know the
by-laws betther than that. But 'twas Bridget O'Grady's eye caught the
red handkerchief, so it did.</p>

<p>"''Tis wavin' his handkerchief at me, he is,' sez she to the
engine-dhriver. 'Good luck to you, mam,' sez he. 'Och the darlint,'
sez she, waving back at Terence, 'he worships the ground I thread
on,' sez she. 'Sure his feelings have overcome him, mam,' sez the
engine-dhriver. 'Och me little Bo-peep,' sez she, blowing kisses to
Terence be the dozen at a time.</p>

<p>"'Is it wantin' me to come to you, so it is,' said Bridget, opening
the carriage door, 'me little love-burrd?' sez she. 'I'm coming to
you, Terence dear,' sez she.</p>

<p>"'She's got you this time, Terence me boy,' said the Docthor,
laughing. ''Tis here your flag is,' sez he. 'Well, wave it you,' said
Terence. ''Tis no flag of mine now,' sez he. 'Boys,' sez he, ''tis
Bridget has let the cat out of the bag this time before 'twas quite
hatched,' sez he. ''Tis this is me flag,' sez he, takin' hould of a
Union Jack from the dicorations, 'and 'tis the flag of ivery thrue
Irishman,' sez he. 'Come along here wid you now, Bridget me jewel,'
sez Terence, 'and see me take the King's shilling from the Docthor,'
sez he.</p>

<p>"'Wasn't it you that was wantin' me to join last night? And didn't
I promise you I'd join at Dublin just as a pleasant surprise for the
Docthor? Sure 'tis you that has the laugh on the lot of them, so it
is, and you breakin' your heart. Will you wave your flag now you have
your eighteen, Docthor asthore? You and your mistakes,' sez he. 'The
mistake I made was in thinkin' that a dacent woman would marry an
Irishman who didn't know his flag,' sez he. 'For the love of Hivin let
her go now, Docthor darlint,' sez he, 'or we'll be late for the
<span class="smcap">Imperor</span>,' sez he."</p>

<p>And that's how Ballymurky made an even number of it.</p>

<h2 class="sans">OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

<p class="title1">(<i>By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.</i>)</p>

<p>I seem to remember that, in the old days of peace, when a friend
was run down or in want of thorough rest, it was a commonplace of
advice to suggest a long voyage in a sailing ship. Somehow I do not
think that, even when mines and traffic raiders are no more, I shall
be quite so ready with this counsel after reading <i>The Mutiny of the
Elsinore</i> (<span class="smcap">Mills and Boon</span>). Of course I
know that a voyage in nautical fiction can never be wholly uneventful,
also that one is justified in looking to Mr. <span class="smcap">Jack
London</span> for something rather strenuous. But really the
<i>Elsinore</i> appears to touch the limit in this kind. I wish I
could tell you properly about her crew. (Mr.
<span class="smcap">London</span> takes chapters and chapters in which
to do it). I suppose that every possible variety of undesirable was
represented among them, from dangerous maniacs downwards. And their
behaviour was what you might expect. The disquieting thing about the
book is that the author gives to its most horrific episodes a cold and
calculated air of truth. "<i>Experto crede</i>," he seems to say;
"thus and thus is the real life of ships." So I had to believe him.
There was only one passenger on board the <i>Elsinore</i>, and he
finished the voyage in command of her. This was after the Captain had
gone wrong in the head, and the First Officer had discovered the
Second to be the murderer of one whom he had sworn to avenge. By this
time also the voyage (which might be called one of attrition) had
considerably reduced the <i>Elsinore's</i> company; while the
survivors were mostly engaged in hurling bombs and vitriol at each
other. What one might call an active, open-air book. But, though I am
far from denying its grim strength, it will not be my favourite among
its author's always interesting romances.</p>

<hr class="mid" />

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gilbert Cannan</span> offers us in <i>Young
Earnest</i> (<span class="smcap">Secker</span>) an extremely
conscientious and plausible study of a talented, sensitive and, I am
afraid, rather "superior" youth whose love affairs preoccupy him too
exclusively and whose demands on life are so exacting that nothing can
ever bring him content. I feel so sure from the good deal which I now
know of young <i>Fourmy</i> and his behaviour to his wife,
<i>Linda</i>, that brilliant suburban, and to <i>Ann</i>, the factory
girl, that he never found with <i>Cathleen</i> the perfect peace which
his creator alleges; or perhaps, more justly, that he never could have
found it without a struggle and self-discipline, of which there are
few signs. It is surely one of the fallacies of a common philosophy of
romance&mdash;a fallacy much too crude for Mr.
<span class="smcap">Cannan's</span> unusually careful method&mdash;that
while this, that and the other relation, opening delightfully, becomes
sordid or impossible some final selection is to prove automatically
and permanently blissful, even if there be no legal ties to chafe
against on principle. The fact is your <i>Fourmys</i> are in this
difficult matter of the affections doomed to trouble as the sparks fly
upward, and of course the perceptive author knows this perfectly well
and his happy ending is only a "let's pretend." I have been fascinated
by the skill of a series of uncannily clear-cut portraits; I know no
other writer who has the power in so singular a degree of getting
right down below surface traits to depths of mood and character.
Analyse it and you will find that Mr.
<span class="smcap">Cannan</span> gives you no descriptions but merely
lets his characters unfold themselves in their talk. There's much in
that "merely."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page60" id="page60"></a>[pg 60]</span></p>

<p><i>Oliver</i>, the hero of <i>The Woman who Looked Back</i>
(<span class="smcap">Stanley Paul</span>), seems to have been a person
of exceptional credulity. Having as a boy married a quite undesirable
foreigner, he subsequently went to India, and on his return accepted
without question his mother's statement that he was a widower. So he
married <i>Sara</i>, the heroine of the tale, and lived in great
placidity for some eight years with her, till the expected happened,
and the discovery of an old letter proved that wife No. 1 was very
much alive. It is at this dramatic crisis that <span class="smcap">M.
Hamilton</span> raises the curtain upon his (or her) story. If I treat
it with flippancy it is not from any dislike of it; on the contrary it
seems to me both interesting and human, especially human. The dialogue
is profoundly and movingly natural; in every chapter I have felt that,
given the postulated situation, the characters would talk exactly
thus, which simply means that <span class="smcap">M. Hamilton</span>
is an adept in her (or his) art. The situation is complicated by the
fact that, though <i>Oliver</i> had accepted his second marriage as an
ideally happy one, <i>Sara</i> in her secret heart was becoming
monstrously bored. Indeed in a soft, play-with-fire fashion she
believed herself in love with <i>Oliver's</i> friend <i>George</i>,
who himself adored her passionately. Naturally, therefore, when the
bomb burst and <i>Sara</i> was no longer the wife of anybody,
<i>George</i> thought his moment had come. I shall not carry the story
of their three-cornered fight further. It remains three-cornered.
Contrary to every accepted custom, the original and only genuine wife
never once appears upon the stage. This strikes me as constituting a
record in the avoidance of the <i>sc&egrave;ne-&agrave;-faire</i>.
Incidentally also it confirms me in my opinion of
<span class="smcap">M. Hamilton</span> as an author of originality and
honesty, whose picture of <i>Sara</i> in particular shows that she
understands a great deal about her own sex.</p>

<hr class="mid" />

<p>My enjoyment of a book that is frankly a study on a special subject
is always limited by the interest of the subject itself, however
prettily the theme be embroidered. The most eloquent disquisition on
postage stamps, for example, would leave me unmoved.
<span class="smcap">Margaret Peterson</span> needs no introduction as
a most eloquent writer on things Indian; yet "Eurasia," her set study
in <i>Tony Bellew</i> (<span class="smcap">Melrose</span>)&mdash;I am not
likening it to philately, and should be sorry to be disrespectful to
either&mdash;so swamps her story, and is in itself so little agreeable,
that I cannot feel much enthusiasm for her latest work. That it is dry
and barren cannot be said of a single page; indeed, I could even wish
that such adjectives might be applicable here and there as a relief
from the&mdash;shall I say?&mdash;clammy fungoid atmosphere that permeates, and
is intended to permeate, the world that lies between the covers of
this volume. The central figure&mdash;certainly not hero, and wanting
something to be man&mdash;exhales in his fickle violences just this miasma;
and rightly so, if the general conception of the book be just, for he
is born of a Bengali mother. Even his final sacrifice to save
<i>Joan</i>, herself about the only character one would care to meet,
is hysterical and unnecessary, and does little to redeem him. I would
gladly believe that the picture of her unpleasant experiences is as
false as, I think you will agree, it is on the whole ugly and
unsympathetic; though I admit that a lack of sympathy is as much
against the intention of the writer as a certain unpleasantness is the
deliberate object of her able craftsmanship. I must place it in your
hands at that, with the advice to read or pass by according to your
interest in the subject.</p>

<hr class="mid" />

<p><i>The Wise Virgins</i> (<span class="smcap">Arnold</span>) is one
of those quaint old-world stories of the day when there were artists
and individualists who despised convention and the stiffness of
ordinary morality and wanted to realise themselves and occupied quite
a lot of our attention. To read it is to plunge back through the mists
of time into the early summer of 1914 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>
And even then I have my doubts as to whether I should have been
persuaded to share the sympathy which <span class="smcap">L. F.
Woolf</span> appears to feel for <i>Harry Davis</i>, the young
Richstead painter. The two types of people among whom his lot is cast
are cleverly if much too bitterly and unkindly contrasted&mdash;the
<i>Garlands</i>, pre-eminently suburban, unable and (all except
<i>Gwen</i>) unwilling to leave their monotonous groove, and the
<i>Lawrences</i>, too cultured and full of &aelig;sthetic
sensibilities to do anything but sit still and talk. <i>Harry</i>
combines the &aelig;sthetic sense with a restless vitality which he
attributes to his Jewish origin, and is desirous of action and
enterprise. And so, rejected by <i>Camilla Lawrence</i>, he talks to
<i>Gwen</i> until she almost compels him to compromise her, and the
book closes with the mockery of a forced marriage in deference to the
sentiments of Philistia. In spite of some skilful and penetrating
satire, I fancy that 1915 will consider <i>The Wise Virgins</i>
neither a very nice nor a very necessary book.</p>
